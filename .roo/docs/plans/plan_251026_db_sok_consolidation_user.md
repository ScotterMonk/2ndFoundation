# Plan User Query: DB SoK Consolidation

Date: 2025-10-26
Short plan name: 251026_db_sok_consolidation
Source starting point: [`.roo/docs/plans/plan_251026_db_sok_consolidation.md`](.roo/docs/plans/plan_251026_db_sok_consolidation.md)
Project size/complexity: Multi-Phase (larger project), many tasks per phase
Autonomy level: High
Testing type: Run py scripts in terminal

User query
- Start a plan using the provided starting point document to consolidate database knowledge sources, utilities, and workflow.

Context snapshot (from starting point)
- Single Source of Truth: PGDB → models_*.py → [`.roo/docs/database_schema.md`](.roo/docs/database_schema.md)
- Redundancy: multiple schema comparison/generation scripts; duplicate schema artifacts
- Target: unify scripts into utils/schema_inspector.py; keep one human-readable schema; add pgdb_changes.md; archive redundant outputs

Constraints and standards
- Always use live PGDB for truth; reflect changes into models and docs
- Follow repo standards in [`.roo/rules/01-general.md`](.roo/rules/01-general.md) and [`.roo/rules/02-database.md`](.roo/rules/02-database.md)
- Keep Python files small; prefer utilities in utils/

Proposed solution overview (high-level)
- Establish SoT hierarchy as policy and practice
- Consolidate utilities into a single schema_inspector with subcommands to generate/compare/report/update
- Consolidate docs: keep database_schema.md and pgdb_changes.md; generate discrepancies on demand
- Update database rules to reference canonical locations and new utility
- Define update protocol and enforce via documentation and simple checks
- Archive legacy scripts and historical outputs under .roo/scripts/schema_analysis/
- Optional: plan CI validation for schema drift (future)

Success criteria
- One canonical inspector utility exists and replaces prior ad-hoc scripts
- Canonical documentation is reduced to a single database_schema.md plus a change log
- Rules updated to point to canonical sources; token footprint reduced
- Repository structure reflects archival of legacy scripts and outputs

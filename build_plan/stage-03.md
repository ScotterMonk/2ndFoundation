# Application: "2nd Foundation" + RL Task

## Application Core Concept
A **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system**
Application architecture, features outline, stack, and user perspective summary in `build_plan/app-summary.md`.

The following is one stage in a multi-stage "application creation project". Do not stray into doing more than is set out here. If you have ideas that might involve additions:
1) Look at the other stages (`build_plan/stage-**.md`) to be sure they do not already cover the functionality.
2) If they do not, consult user.

## STAGE 03: Application Architecture
Create directory structure
- Folders and skeleton files
- File Organization
- Module Responsibilities
- Extraction Points (⭐ marked files for assignment submission)

Use `build_plan/app-summary.md`

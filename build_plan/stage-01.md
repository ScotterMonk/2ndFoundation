# Application: "2nd Foundation" + RL Task

## Application Core Concept
A **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system**
Application features outline, stack, and user perspective summary in `build_plan/app-summary.md`.

## STAGE 01: Database Schema
- Phase: Document Model (with embeddings and ts_vector)
- Phase: SearchQuery Model (analytics)
- Phase: ModelSubmission Model (RL task tracking)
- Phase: TestCase Model (grading test cases)
- Phase: User Model (authentication)

## Proposed Database Schema
Before using, scrutinize this for accuracy and completeness:
- `build_plan/ref-database-schema.md` (db schema to build)

**Context Needed**: 
 - `build_plan/app-summary.md`

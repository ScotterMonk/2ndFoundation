    Application: "2nd Foundation" - A document retrieval system using pgVector for semantic search.
    
    Problem: Pure vector search sometimes misses exact keyword matches that users expect.
    For example, searching for "SELECT * FROM users" should find SQL code snippets,
    but semantic search might return conceptual database articles instead.
    
    Task: Implement a hybrid search function that combines semantic and keyword search
    using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

    Implementation requirements:
        1. Call both helper functions to get candidate results
        2. Apply RRF formula: score(d) = Î£(1 / (k + rank_i)) where k=60
           - rank_i is the 1-indexed position in each result list
           - Sum across all lists where document appears
        3. Merge results, handling duplicates correctly
        4. Return top 'limit' documents ordered by RRF score DESC
    
    Edge cases to handle:
        - Documents appearing in both result sets (merge RRF scores)
        - Documents appearing in only one result set
        - Empty results from one or both searches

## Description
{task.description}

## Requirements
{task.requirements}

## Evaluation Criteria

Your implementation will be tested on:

1. **Correctness (60%)**: Do the expected documents appear in the top-K results?
2. **Ranking Quality (30%)**: Is the RRF score calculated correctly?
3. **Edge Cases (10%)**: Does it handle unusual inputs gracefully?

## Common Failure Modes to Avoid

- Using wrong k value (e.g., k=1 or k=100)
- 0-indexed instead of 1-indexed ranks
- Not summing RRF scores for duplicates
- Crashes on empty results
- SQL injection vulnerabilities

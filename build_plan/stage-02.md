# Application: "2nd Foundation" + RL Task

## Application Core Concept
A **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system**
Application features outline, stack, and user perspective summary in `build_plan/app-summary.md`.

The following is one stage in a multi-stage "application creation project". Do not stray into doing more than is set out here. If you have ideas that might involve additions:
1) Look at the other stages (`build_plan/stage-**.md`) to be sure they do not already cover the functionality.
2) If they do not, consult user.

## STAGE 02: Test Data Generation (`build_plan/plan-part-07.md`)
- Phase 1: Test Documents (50 docs across categories)
  - Code Snippets (15 docs - keyword-heavy)
  - ML Concepts (15 docs - semantic-heavy)
  - General Knowledge (10 docs - mixed content)
  - Edge Cases (10 docs - boundary testing)
- Phase 2: Test Queries (with expected results)
- Phase 3: SQL Export for Assignment Submission
